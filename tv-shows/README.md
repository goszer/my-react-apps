# TV Shows app

## Additional feature ideas üë®‚Äçüé®

[] Implement search bar
[] Add message "No results found" when no results are returned from the api
[] Make favorites persistent (https://github.com/rehooks/local-storage)
[] Add a new button "Load more" and implement pagination
[] Implement endless scrolling
[] Separate app in 2 menus: Popular / Favorites
[] Add a way to view the trailer (not sure if it's possible anymore with the new version of their api)

## API

At first we have to create an account in [https://www.themoviedb.org/](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

Then we have to obtain an API key from the settings page: [https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api). We will use the v3 auth.

The api must be present in every api call:

```
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?api_key={api_key}
```

We need to store this api key in our project. Create React App provides already a way for us to define [custom environment variables](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/). This functionality is provided by a package called `react-scripts`.

In the root folder of our application we can add a dot file named `.env.local` for our local development environment with the following contents:

```jsx
REACT_APP_API_KEY = your_api_key;
```

Apart from that we can have multiple other keys according to the environment:

```jsx
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local
```

The variable becomes available to our project:

```jsx
process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY;
```

Please remember to restart your development server, auto reload will not catch this change.
